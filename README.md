## Dummy data used in the demonstration

If you would like a copy of the data used in the demonstration, please contact [the Specialist Analytics Team](mailto:scwcsu.analytics.specialist@nhs.net). The dummy data is based on real activity data, and while the original data was not patient-level and efforts have been made to further de-identify it, we have not uploaded it to this public repository as a precaution.
